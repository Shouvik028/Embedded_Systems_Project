## 🧊 Fridge Door Alarm System
---

The **Fridge Door Alarm System** 🚪🔔 is an embedded electronics project created to boost both **food safety** 🍎 and **energy efficiency** ⚡ in your household refrigerator! 

Powered by an **LPC1768 microcontroller** and an **MH infrared sensor** 🕹️, this system keeps constant watch over your fridge door. When the door is left open too long, you get instant alerts: a flashing LED 💡 and a loud buzzer 🔊! 

By encouraging everyone to close the fridge door promptly, this project helps:
- Reduce food spoilage 🥦
- Save energy 🌱
